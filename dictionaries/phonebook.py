# Write a program that receives info from the console about people and their phone numbers.
# Each entry should have a name and a number (both strings) separated by a "-". If you receive a name that already exists in the phonebook, update its number.
# After filling the phonebook, you will receive a number â€“ N. Your program should be able to perform a search of contact by name and print its details in the format: 
# "{name} -> {number}". In case the contact isn't found, print: "Contact {name} does not exist."
